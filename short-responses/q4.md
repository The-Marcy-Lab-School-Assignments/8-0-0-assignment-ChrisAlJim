# Question

The endpoint `/api/data` is handled by the controller `serveData` below.

If I send a request to `/api/data?filter=frog`, how do I get the value of the query parameter `filter`?

```js
const serveData = (req, res, next) => {
  const filterValue = ???
  // use the filterValue and send back a response
}
app.get('/api/data', serveData);
```

# Answer

You get it through the `req` object. The `req` object contains info about the incoming request. This means it contains info the the query params too. In this case wo would access it by:

```js
const filterValue = req.query.filter;
```
