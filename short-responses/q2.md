# Question

`app.get(endpoint, controller)` takes in an `endpoint` as the first argument.

What is an endpoint in Express?

# Answer

An endpoint in Express is a URL path that when hit will send a request based on what method we we use on app.

# Teacher Feedback

So close, when the endpoint is hit, it will not send a request but rather a response. The client can send a request to the endpoint which will cause the controller to parse the request and send a response.
